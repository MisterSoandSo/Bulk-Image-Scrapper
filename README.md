# Bulk Image Scrapper

 The Bulk Image Scrapper application introduces a modern GUI powered by [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter/tree/master), replacing the previous console-only interface. The simple GUI provides an easily accessible interface for scraping image CDNs for personal use. This application was specifically made to handle JPEG, PNG, and GIF image types using a sequential naming scheme. It is compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux systems.
